# Installation

### NPM

```sh
$ npm install --save fuse.js
```

### Yarn

```sh
$ yarn add fuse.js
```

### CDN

For prototyping or learning purposes, you can use the latest version with:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fuse.js/dist/fuse.js"></script>
```

For production, we recommend linking to a specific version number and build to avoid unexpected breakage from newer versions:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fuse.js@5.2.2"></script>
```

If you are using native ES Modules, there is also an ES Modules compatible build:

```html
<script type="module">
  import Fuse from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fuse.js@5.2.2/dist/fuse.esm.js'
</script>
```

You can browse the source of the NPM package at cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fuse.js.

Fuse.js is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/fuse.js).

Make sure to read about the different builds of Fuse.js and use the production
version in your published site, replacing fuse.js with fuse.min.js. This is a smaller build optimized for speed instead of development experience.
