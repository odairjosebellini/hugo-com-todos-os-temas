# What is Fuse.js?

<social-share :networks="['twitter', 'reddit', 'linkedin', 'email']" />

Fuse.js is a **powerful, lightweight fuzzy-search library, with zero dependencies**.

### What is fuzzy searching?

Generally speaking, fuzzy searching (more formally known as _approximate string matching_) is the technique of finding strings that are _approximately_ equal to a given pattern (rather than _exactly_).

### Why should I use it?

1. With Fuse.js, you donâ€™t need to setup a dedicated backend just to handle search.
2. Simplicity and performance were the main criteria when developing this library.

### When should I use It?

It might not make sense for every situation, but can be ideal depending on your search requirements. For example:

1. When you want client-side fuzzy searching of small to moderately large data sets.
2. When you can't justify setting up a dedicated backend simply to handle search. ElasticSearch or Algolia, although both great services, may be overkill for your particular use cases.

### Can I still use it on the backend?

Of course! Fuse.js has no DOM dependencies.
