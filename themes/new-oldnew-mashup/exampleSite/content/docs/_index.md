Modern high-contrast CSS3 & HTML5 [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme
inspired by old-school themes.

It attempts to be accessible, private, and responsive.

The theme is currently a work in progress, but there are still useful
releases from time to time.

## Example Site

``/exampleSite`` contains some example content as per
["Add a theme to hugoThemes list"](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes#adding-a-theme-to-the-list),
including the documentation and a sample of how to use the theme.
